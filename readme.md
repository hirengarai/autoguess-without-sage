# Autoguess without Sage

A standalone implementation of the Autoguess tool that does not require SageMath. This script parses connection and algebraic relations, builds and solves the corresponding Macaulay matrix, and outputs the results.

> **Note:** This implementation is heavily inspired from the original [autoguess](https://github.com/hadipourh/autoguess.git) project, and follows the same directory and file structure.


## Prerequisites

Before using this tool, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Minizinc**
- **Z3**: It is the default SMT solver  
- **setuptools**: For packaging support.

### Python dependencies

Install the required Python packages via `pip`:

```bash
# 1. Core package manager fix (usually already present)
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

# 2. Install MiniZinc Python interface
pip install minizinc

# 3. Install PySAT with optional solvers
pip install 'python-sat[pblib,aiger]'

# 4. Install PySMT
pip install pysmt
pysmt-install --z3   # Still needed separately to install Z3 backend


# 5. Galois includes numpy, so no need to install numpy separately
pip install galois
```

### Defaults

- cp solver: gecode [comes with minizinc]
- sat solver: cadical153 [possibly with pysat]
- smt solver: z3

### To Do
- MILP, Gröbner basis method is not supported
- The preprocessing phase for long systems is quite a bit slow (e.g. in the PRESENT)
